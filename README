This repository has been forked from OpenIndiana which modifies their default Nimbus theme to work on Linux.  The theme supports both GTK2 and GTK3, and includes the icon theme.  Paired with the DMZ cursor theme, its almost like we're running Open Solaris again!

Currently to build, simply type

./autogen.sh
make
sudo make install

If for some reason the theme does not appear, try moving the files from "/usr/local/share/themes" to "/usr/local/themes", or alternatively "$HOME/.themes".
